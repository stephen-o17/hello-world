# hello-world
This is a readme for my first solo repository, hello world.

Hi, this is just some information about me
Right now I'm testing how to make changes to a file
And also how to make a branch, and make edits on a branch
Then commit and push to complete

This is the resource I used to help me:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
